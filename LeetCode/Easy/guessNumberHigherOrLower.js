/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/description/
 * This is a binary search algorithm that guesses a number between 1 and n by repeatedly dividing the
 * search interval in half.
 * @param n - The parameter `n` represents the maximum number in the range of possible numbers to
 * guess. The function `guessNumber` uses binary search to guess a number between 1 and `n`.
 * @returns If the function runs successfully and finds the correct number, it will return the guessed
 * number. If it does not find the correct number, it will return -1.
 *
 * Time complexity : O(log‚Å°2n)
 * Space complexity : O(1)
