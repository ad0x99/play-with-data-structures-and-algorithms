 *
 * Recursion with Depth-first Search & Backtracking Approach
 *
 * 1. We initialize the following variables:
 * - 1.1: The `longestString` variable to -1 and will store the length of the longest valid string found so far.
 * - 1.2: The `result` Set object is used to store the unique valid strings found during the search. Using a Set ensures we don't add duplicate strings.
 * - 1.3: The `currentSolution` array will hold the current combination of parentheses (including letters) being explored during the search.
 * - 1.4: The `openingCount` variable keeps track of the number of opening parentheses (() encountered so far.
 * - 1.5: The `closingCount` variable keeps track of the number of closing parentheses ()) encountered so far.
 *
 * 2. The base case:
 * - 2.1: If `currentIdx` reaches the end of the string, it means we've processed all characters.
 * - 2.2: Inside the base case, if we found potentially valid parentheses combination.
 * - 2.3: And if we found a new longest valid string, then we update `longestString` with the new length, clear the result set to remove previous entries (we only want the longest valid strings for a given length), and we add the current valid string to the result set.
 * - 2.4: Otherwise, if the current valid string has the same length as the longest found so far, simply add it to the result set (we might have multiple longest strings).
 *
 * 3. Recursive Exploration: There are 3 scenarios where the current string is an opening or closing parenthesis, and a letter.
 *
 * 4. If the current character is an opening parenthesis:
 * - 4.1: We add the opening parenthesis to the currentSolution.
 * - 4.2: We make a recursive call to dfs with increased currentIdx to move to the next character, updated currentSolution with the added opening parenthesis, incremented openingCount, and unchanged closingCount.
 * - 4.3: After the recursive call, we remove the opening parenthesis from currentSolution (backtracking).
 * - 4.4: This explores the possibility of including the opening parenthesis in the valid combination.
 *
 * 5. If the current character is a closing parenthesis, there are two sub-cases to consider here are to skip or include the closing parenthesis.
 *
 * 6. If we choose to skip the closing parenthesis.
 * - 6.1: We make a recursive call to dfs with, increased currentIdx, unchanged currentSolution, unchanged openingCount, and unchanged closingCount.
 * - 6.2: This explores the possibility of excluding the closing parenthesis from the valid combination.
 *
 * 7. If we choose to include the closing parenthesis only if openingCount > closingCount. This check ensures we only include closing parentheses if there are enough opening parentheses before it. Otherwise, it wouldn't be a valid combination.
 * - 7.1: We add the closing parenthesis to currentSolution
 * - 7.2: We make a recursive call to dfs with increased currentIdx, updated currentSolution with the added closing parenthesis, unchanged openingCount, and incremented closingCount.
 * - 7.3: After the recursive call, we remove the closing parenthesis from currentSolution (backtracking).
 * - 7.4: This explores the possibility of including the closing parenthesis in the valid combination, but only if it's a valid placement.
 *
 * 8. If the current character is a letter:
 * - 8.1. We simply add the letter to the currentSolution and make a recursive call to dfs with all parameters unchanged.
 * - 8.2: After the recursive call, remove the letter from currentSolution (backtracking).
 * - 8.3: This includes the letter in the current combination and continues exploring
 *
 * Time complexity: O(2 ^ n) - where n is the length of the input string. This is because in the worst case scenario, we are exploring all possible combinations of removing parentheses from the input string.
 *
 * Space complexity: O(n)

/**
 * Recursion with Breadth-first Search & Backtracking Approach
 *
 * 1. We initialize a `result` Set object to store the unique valid strings found during the search. Using a Set ensures we don't add duplicate strings, a queue to store strings that will be explored in a Breadth-First Search (BFS) manner,and a found boolean flag to track if a valid string has been found in the current level of BFS exploration.
 *
 * 2. As long as there is element in the queue, we continue the loop
 *
 * 3. Inside the loop:
 * - 3.1: We initialize `numberOfString` variable to store the number of strings in the current level (number of elements in the queue at the beginning of the loop).
 * - 3.2: We initialize `seen` as a new Set object for each level to keep track of strings already explored within that level. This avoids revisiting the same string with a single character removed multiple times in the same level.
 *
 * 4. Exploring Strings in a Level: We iterate through each string (currentString) in the current level.
 * - 4.1: The first string in the queue is removed.
 * - 4.2: We check if the current string is valid (if the string has balanced parentheses), we add it to the result set and set found to true to indicate a valid string was found in this level.
 * - 4.3: If found is true, we can skip the rest of the exploration for this level (optimization) because we're only interested in finding the shortest valid strings.
 *
 * 5. Generating and Adding New Strings: We iterate through each character (j) in the currentString.
 * - 5.1: We will skip characters that are not opening or closing parentheses.
 * - 5.2: We create a new string (nextString) by removing the character at index j from currentString.
 * - 5.2: If the new string (nextString) hasn't been explored in the current level, we add the new string to the `seen` set to mark it as explored in this level and to the queue for exploration in the next level.
 *
 * 6. If found becomes true after processing a level, we break the loop. This is because we're only interested in the shortest valid strings, and finding one in a level guarantees no shorter strings will be found in later levels.
 *
 * 7. After the BFS exploration finishes, we convert the result set (containing unique valid strings) to an array and return it.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(2^n), where n is the length of the input `string`. This is because in the worst case scenario, we are exploring all possible combinations of removing parentheses from the input string.
 *
 * Space complexity: O(2^n) because in the worst case scenario, the `queue` can contain all possible combinations of the input string after removing parentheses.
