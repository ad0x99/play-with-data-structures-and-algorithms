 *
 * Dynamic Programming Approach
 *
 * Implementation
 *
 * 1. We create m and n to store the lengths of text1 and text2, respectively.
 *
 * 2. We initialize a 2D dynamic programming array `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` will represent the LCS length of `text1[0..i-1]` and `text2[0..j-1]`. It's filled with zeros, representing the base case where no characters from either string are used (empty string comparison).
 *
 * 3. We iterate over each character of text1 and text2 using two nested loops (one for each string). At each iteration, we compare the current character at text1 (`text1[i-1]`) and the current character at text2 (`text2[j-1]`). There are two possibilities:
 * - 3.1: Characters match: If `text1[i-1] === text2[j-1]`, it means that adding these characters extends the LCS by 1. So, `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.
 *
 * - 3.2: Characters do not match: If the characters donâ€™t match, we take the maximum value from either excluding the current character of text1 (`dp[i-1][j]`) or excluding the current character of text2 (`dp[i][j-1]`). This step ensures that we find the LCS by considering either or both strings without their current character.
 *
 * 4. After filling the dp table, the value in `dp[m][n]` represents the length of the LCS for text1 and text2.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(m * n), where m is the number of characters of text1, and n is the number of characters of text2.
 *
 * Space complexity: O(m * n)
