 *
 * Topological Sort Approach
 *
 * Idea: We can assume that each course is a vertex (node) in the graph, the prerequisites can be represented as a graph where an edge from course A to course B indicates that course A must be taken before course B.
 *
 * Since we need to know all of the indirect and direct prerequisites of a course, each time we explore a course, we want to keep track all of indirect and direct in the same time.
 *
 * Here, we will use a edgeMap to store the relationship such that the key is the current course and its value will contain all of courses that it depends on, it means the prerequisites list of the current course.
 *
 * Then, if we want to check whether a course A is prerequisite of B or not, we just want to check in the list of prerequisites of A. If B is included in the prerequisites list of A, that's mean, B is prerequisite of A.
 *
 * For example:
 * - numCourses = 5
 * - prerequisites = [[3, 4], [2, 3], [1, 2], [0, 1]]
 * - queries = [[0, 4], [4, 0], [1, 3], [3, 0]]
 * - result = [ false, false, false, false ]
 *
 * ```js
 * edgeMap(5) { 0 => [], 1 => [ 0 ], 2 => [ 1 ], 3 => [ 2 ], 4 => [ 3 ] }
 *
 * reachability(5) {
 *    0 => Set(1) { 0 },
 *    1 => Set(2) { 0, 1 },
 *    2 => Set(2) { 1, 2 },
 *    3 => Set(2) { 2, 3 },
 *    4 => Set(1) { 3 }
 *  }
 * ```
 *
 * Implementation
 *
 * 1. We create a map (edgeMap) where each key is a course, and its value is a list of courses that the current course depends on directly. It means, if we want to take the current course, all of the courses in this list need to be taken first.
 *
 * 2. We create another map (reachability), where each key is a course, and its value is a set of all the courses that the current course can be reached from either directly or indirectly. It means, all the courses in the list are prerequisites for the current course.
 *
 * 3. The `DFS` function: For each course, we perform a DFS to determine all the courses that can be reached from it. During DFS, if a course A can reach course B, then A is a prerequisite for B. We update the reachability set for B to include A. It means, we update the set of B to contain all of its prerequisites.
 * - 3.1: We iterate through each course to explore all possible paths starting from each course.
 *
 * - 3.2: If the course hasn't been visited yet, we run DFS to explore all courses that can be reached from it. It means we explore all the course might be the indirect prerequisite of the current course.
 *
 * 4: The `BFS` function: For each course, we perform a BFS starting from the current course to explore all directly reachable courses (its neighbors) and mark them as reachable in the reachability map.
 * - 4.1: We create a queue to store a list of dependent courses need to be explored.
 *
 * - 4.2: As long as the queue is not empty, we explore all the dependent course of the current course.
 *
 * - 4.3: If the dependent course is not visited yet, we mark the current dependent course as reachable for the current course by adding it to the dependent list of the current course.
 *
 * - 4.4: We then add the dependent course to the queue to explore more dependent courses.
 *
 * 5. The `isPrerequisiteOf` checks if a course `u` is prerequisite of `v` by exploring the reachability list. If the course `u` exits in the reachability list of course `v`, that means, course `u` is prerequisite of `v`.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(q * (n + m)), whereP q is the number of queries, n is the number of courses (vertices), and m is the number of prerequisite pairs (edges).
 * - DFS: O(m + n)
 * - isPrerequisiteOf: O(1)
 *
 * Space complexity: O(n ^ 2),  in the worst case, as each course (vertex) can potentially reach all other courses (vertices)
