 *
 * Min Heap Approach
 *
 * Idea: Prioritize using ladders as much as possible for largest jumps (tallest building differences). And then, using bricks for the smaller jumps to converse ladders for when they are most needed.
 *
 * Implementation
 *
 * 1. We use a min-heap (minHeap) to store the differences between buildings (i.e., how much higher the next building is compared to the current one). A heap is used because we need to prioritize the smallest differences for bricks, leaving ladders for larger differences.
 *
 * 2. We loop through each building, and compare the difference of distance of each building with the next one.
 *
 * 3. For each pair of consecutive buildings, we calculate the difference in height. If the next building is taller than the current one (distanceBetweenBuildings > 0), we must decide whether to use bricks or a ladder to overcome the difference.
 *
 * 4. If the height difference is greater than zero (i.e., the next building is taller), we insert the difference into the min-heap. The min-heap ensures that the smallest height differences are at the root of the heap, so that ladders can be used on the largest differences.
 *
 * 5. If the size of the min-heap exceeds the number of ladders available, we start using bricks for the smallest jumps (those at the top of the min-heap).
 *
 * 6. After that, we use remove the smallest height difference from the heap, and subtract that difference from the number of bricks, indicating the number of bricks have been used.
 *
 * 7. If we've used more bricks than available (bricks < 0), it means we canâ€™t make this jump, so return the index of the current building which is the furthest building we can reach.
 *
 * 8. If we successfully get through all the buildings without running out of bricks or ladders, we return the last building's index (n - 1), meaning we've reached the furthest building.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(n log n)
 *
 * Space complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the heap.
